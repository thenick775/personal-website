This is the home of my personal website, desktop and mobile friendly.

I thought after a few years and a few jobs, that my website needed a new look!

I chose to make this project with Hugo, as an exercise in learning something new.

Major thanks to the [Hugo Grayscale](https://github.com/runningstream/hugograyscale) template creator for inspiration.

This project is powered by Docker and NGINX, and is served from a cloud hosting provider.
