## About Me

My name is Nicholas VanCise, and puzzles are my favorite pastime!  
Currently I'm working on my masters at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, as well as pursuing my dreams as a software engineer. 

In addition to this, in my own time I dabble in iOS development, webscraping, data visualization, and infrastructure programming.

When I'm not studying or working on my personal projects I spend my time  
enjoying nature, reading science fiction, and working  
on classic vehicles.
