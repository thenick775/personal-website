## About Me

My name is Nicholas VanCise, and puzzles are my favorite pastime!  
Currently I am working on my masters at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, as well as pursuing my dreams as a software engineer. 

In addition to this, in my own time I dabble in iOS development, webscraping, data visualization, and infrastructure programming.

When I'm not studying or working on my personal projects I spend my time enjoying science fiction, creating metal music, and working on older vehicles.
